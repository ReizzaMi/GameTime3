# GameTime3
Revamp of the previous two text based rpg experiments

This file is a big diversion from previous logic, and it all came down to learning structures.  
I learned this concept with hearts in my eyes.  I think that one of the coolest things about 
learning programming is that often new concepts answer existing questions, and things just click into place.

Arrays have their uses but structures are much more flexible and much harder to make mistakes with.  Arrays
just weren't a good fit for this project.

Again I did try to make a game that could expand as it grows.  For now it's not at the functional level yet, and 
many concepts (such as user inventory) will not be fleshed out until I have a working battle system in place.  Once the 
basics are finalized then I can expand the game experience to really flex my logical muscle.
